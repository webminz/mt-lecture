# Solutions

There exist two solution attempts.
The files I created/presented in the extra walkthrough session on Feb 24th 9am-10am are available in `/patrick` and contain the solutions for Exercise 2 and 3.1 to 3.2.

Thankfully Tim Kr√§uter also made his solution available under `/tim`, which contains a complete solution for 2, 3.1 to 3.4 (class table inheritance), and 4.
